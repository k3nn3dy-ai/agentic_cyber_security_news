# Cybersecurity Research Report for the week ending 2025-01-30

## Executive Summary

The week ending 2025-01-30 has witnessed several significant cybersecurity developments that demand immediate attention from the global security community. Most notably, a major data breach at PowerSchool exposed over 300,000 North Carolina teachers' Social Security numbers, highlighting persistent vulnerabilities in educational sector security. The cybersecurity landscape shows concerning trends with a 22% increase in cyber-attack breakout times and US data breach victim counts reaching 1.7 billion. 

Critical infrastructure protection has gained prominence, with the Department of Defense emphasizing cybersecurity measures for military systems and Orange County conducting large-scale cyber preparedness exercises. International concerns are escalating, particularly regarding election security in the EU, where member states are calling for enhanced protections against foreign interference.

Of particular concern is the emergence of AI-enabled threats, specifically GhostGPT's potential exploitation for cyberattacks, and a critical vulnerability discovered in SonicWall systems requiring immediate attention.
